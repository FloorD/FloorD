### Hi there üëã

My name is Floor - yup, that's really pronounced like *"the floor is lava"*. I use she/her pronouns. I'm a champion supporter of Open Source Software at my employer `[insert company name here]`, and I care ‚ù£Ô∏è **a lot** ‚ù£Ô∏è about diversity, equity and inclusion, and sustainability. 

I write about tech. Like [here](https://dev.to/floord). And (previously) [here](https://medium.com/@floriendrees). I'm a Devopsdays Core member, and organize [Devopsdays Amsterdam](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-amsterdam/welcome/), and [Devopsdays Eindhoven](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-eindhoven/welcome/). I'm also an organizer for [PGDay Lowlands](https://2024.pgday.nl), a Postgres event. 

Best reach me on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@floord), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/floord.bsky.social) or using the email in my profile üëà
