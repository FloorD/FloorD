### Hi there 👋

My name is Floor - yup, that's really pronounced like *"the floor is yours"*, but I appreciate y'all trying to make it sound more fancy 💅. I use she/her pronouns. I'm a champion supporter of Open Source Software at my employer `[insert company name here]`, and I care ❣️ **a lot** ❣️ about diversity, equity and inclusion, and accessibility. I'm a Microsoft MVP for Developer Technologies.

I organize a bazillion tech events, like [Devopsdays Amsterdam](https://devopsdays.org/events/2022-amsterdam/welcome/), Devopsdays Eindhoven, and the [Amsterdam Ruby Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-rb/).

I (used to) write about tech A Lot. Like [here](https://medium.com/@floriendrees). And [here](https://dev.to/floord). I've enjoyed my recent involvement in the [Web Development for Beginners curriculum](https://aka.ms/webdev-beginners), my work on [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/build-community-driven-projects-github/), as well as porting edu content to git and GitHub. 

If you're like me and you're interested in ethical use of and for tech, consider checking out the [Ethical Source project](https://ethicalsource.dev/).

Best reach me on the [Twitters](https://twitter.com/floordrees), or using the email in my profile 👈
