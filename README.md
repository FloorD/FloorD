### Hi there 👋

My name is Floor - yup, that's really pronounced like *"the floor is yours"*, but I appreciate y'all trying to make it sound more fancy 💅. I use she/her pronouns. I'm a champion supporter of Open Source Software at my employer `[insert company name here]`, and I care ❣️ **a lot** ❣️ about diversity, equity and inclusion, and accessibility. 

I organize a bazillion tech events, and run [contibuting.today](https://contributing.today) - a weekly "accidental user group" on OSS topics. 

I used to write about tech A Lot. Like [here](https://medium.com/@floriendrees). And [here](https://blog.phusion.nl/author/floor-drees/). I've enjoyed my recent involvement in the [Web Development for Beginners curriculum](https://aka.ms/webdev-beginners), my work on [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/build-community-driven-projects-github/), as well as porting edu content to git and GitHub. 

If you're like me and you're interested in ethical use of and for tech, consider subscribing to [Don Goodman-Wilson's excellent newsletter](https://buttondown.email/DEGoodmanWilson/).

Best reach me on the [Twitters](https://twitter.com/floordrees), or using the email in my profile 👈
