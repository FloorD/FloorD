### Hi there üëã

My name is Floor - yup, that's really pronounced like *"the floor is lava"*. I use she/her pronouns. I'm a champion supporter of Open Source Software at my employer `[insert company name here]`, and I care ‚ù£Ô∏è **a lot** ‚ù£Ô∏è about diversity, equity and inclusion, and accessibility. 

I organize a bazillion tech events, like [Devopsdays Amsterdam](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-amsterdam/welcome/), [Devopsdays Eindhoven](https://devopsdays.org/events/2022-eindhoven/welcome/), and the [Amsterdam Ruby Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-rb/).

I write about tech. Like [here](https://dev.to/floord). And (previously) [here](https://medium.com/@floriendrees). I'm a Microsoft MVP for Developer Technologies, and I'm a Devopsdays Core organizer.

If you're like me and you're interested in ethical use of and for tech, consider checking out the [Ethical Source project](https://ethicalsource.dev/).

Best reach me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.lol/@floord), or using the email in my profile üëà
